# Prevention of Sexual Harassment

## What kinds of behaviour cause sexual harassment?

  Any unwelcome verbal, visual or physical conduct of a sexual nature that is severe or pervasive and affects working conditions or creates a hostile work environment.
There are three forms of sexual harassment, which are as follows:

### Verbal Harassment

  Verbal Harassment includes comments about clothing, a person's body, sexual or gender-based jokes or remarks, requesting sexual favours or repeatedly asking a person out. It also includes sexual innuendos, threats, spreading rumours about a person's personal or sexual life or using foul and obscene language. 

### Visual Harassment

  Visual Harassment includes obscene posters, drawings/pictures, screensavers, cartoons, Emails or texts of a sexual nature. 

### Physical Harassment

  Physical Harassment includes sexual assaults, impeding or blocking movement, inappropriate touching such as kissing, hugging, patting, stroking or rubbing, sexual gesturing, or even leering or staring.

Each of these forms of harassment can be broken down into two categories:

#### Quid Pro Quo

  Quid Pro Qua can be easily understood as "This for That". This happens when an employer or supervisor uses job rewards or punishments to coerce an employee into a sexual relationship or sexual act. This includes offering employee raises, promotions for complying or threatening demotions, firing or other penalties for not complying with the request. 

#### Hostile Work Environment

  A hostile work environment occurs when an employee's behaviour interferes with the work performance of other employees or creates an intimidating or offensive workplace. This usually happens when someone makes repeated sexual comments and makes another employee feel so uncomfortable that their work performance suffers or they decline professional opportunities because it would put them in contact with the harasser.

In either type of harassment, employees only have to prove that the behavior was offensive to someone even if it was not the intended recipient. For example, employee 'A' tells a dirty joke to employee 'B' and "B" loves the joke and laughs. However, employee 'C' happens to be walking by when the joke is told and 'C' is offended by the joke. That joke could contribute to a hostile environment claim, because 'C', who happened to be in the area finds the dirty joke offensive.

## What would you do if you faced or witnessed any incident or repeated incidents of such behaviour?

If I faced or witnessed any incident or repeated incidents of sexual behaviour, I'd take the following steps in order: 
* First I'd tell that person to stop if I don't feel comfortable telling the person to stop
* If I do tell them and they don't stop, I'd follow my organization's grievance procedure, if I don't know what those procedures are I'll talk to my supervisor
* If my supervisor harasses me, I'll report it to his or her supervisor, someone in HR or another person I feel comfortable with up the chain of command.

## Explains different scenarios enacted by actors.

### Scenario 1: Artistic freedom
  In this scenario, the woman let her colleague know by her remarks that she didn't appreciate his sense of art, the sexual poster he pasted near his desk, but he didn't want to understand the feelings of his colleague. 

### Scenario 2: You got to keep trying
  In this scenario, the woman repeatedly asked her male colleague for a date, even though he told her he wasn't interested in her and didn't want to go on a date. But she didn't consider his feelings.

### Scenario 3: The jokes on you
  In this scenario, a woman in the office sends a joke to everyone to lighten things up in the office, others may have found it funny too but someone in particular finds it inappropriate, which makes this harassment towards the one who didn't find this funny, in this case, a female colleague.

### Scenario 4: The Legend
  In this scenario, it was fairly clear that the woman found the hug unwelcome, she staged her preference by extending her hand and then she said, hug going to make my day any better Ron, though the man continued which constituted a hostile work environment sexual harassment.

### Scenario 5: Odd man out
  In this scenario, the male supervisor was giving special attention to a particular female subordinate in the workplace which is perceived as a sense of special treatment to another subordinate. This gives rise to a sense of unfairness which is a Quid Pro Quo sexual harassment against the disadvantaged employee.

### Scenario 6: The contract
  In this scenario, a male team lead and a female client were in a contract discussion inside a restaurant, though the man was focused on the contract and hinted towards the same she was more focused on gaining the advantage over the contract through sexually enticing the man, which constitutes sexual harassment against the man.

### Scenario 7: Twisted words
  In this scenario, a man made a suggestive comment towards a female colleague using sexual appeal to crack a deal with the client which constitutes a hostile work environment for the female.

### Scenario 8: Equal appreciation
  In this scenario, a female employee made an equally inappropriate comment by both a male and a female colleague, but she was offended by the woman and not by a man. This scenario depicts that though a person can not be an equal recipient of the other others should be equally respectful to each other.

### Scenario 9: Everyone loves a compliment
  In this scenario, a male colleague was repeatedly giving compliments over her looks, at first we could see that she was happy but after a while could see the unease on her face as she felt weird after those repeated compliments given to her by her colleague.

### Scenario 10: Testing the water
  In this scenario, a male superior and his female subordinate had a good work relationship, but he tried to test the water with her by indirectly conveying her desire, which offsets the subordinate resulting in the loss of a perfectly good work relationship between them.

## How to handle cases of harassment?
There are many ways of handling cases of harassment I will discuss them:
* the first thing to think about doing when you feel you're being harassed is to tell the person to stop.
* Next if that doesn't work tell your supervisor
* If the supervisor is the harasser then tell his supervisor or someone like HR.
* If a client harrases you or the contracts depended on the sexual favours then you should document what happened and what was said, so if things escalate you should talk to a supervisor.


## How to behave appropriately?
The guidelines to consider here are to ask yourself:
  * Would you do or say the same thing in the same way if your wife, husband, son, daughter or other loved one was standing right next to you? if not don't do it at work.
  * Is what you're doing potentially crossing a personal or physical boundary of another person? like touching, unless you know a person well and have certainty that any kind of touching besides a handshake is welcome don't do it at work.
  * Has the person given you notice in any way? If they show any discomfort stop immediately.
* Other than these you should be mindful: 
  * Whenever you manage people it's important to treat them equally, performance should be the only thing that's rewarded.
  * Professionalism by everyone in dressing and behaviour is necessary.
  * Testing of personal interaction can potentially destroy an otherwise excellent working relationship.
