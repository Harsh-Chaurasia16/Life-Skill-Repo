# Grit and Growth Mindset

## Grit

Grit is passion and perseverance for very long-term goals. Grit is sticking with your future, day in, and day out, for years, and working really hard to make that future a reality. Grit is living life like it's a marathon, not a sprint. The best idea about building grit in kids is something called a "growth mindset". This is an idea developed at Stanford University by Carol Dweck, and it is the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed and that it can change with effort. With a growth mindset, a person is much more likely to persevere when they fail, because they don't believe that failure is a permanent condition. So growth mindset is a great idea for building grit.

## Introduction to Growth Mindset

According to Carol Dweck, there are two ways of thinking about skill development, fixed mindset i.e. your skills and abilities are what you are born with and Growth mindset i.e. skills and abilities are acquired and can be enhanced. This is a spectrum where sometimes you might be fixed or sometimes in growth. since this works on mindset, we need to zoom in on the belief and focus and create a real growth mindset.

## What is the Internal Locus of Control? What is the key point in the video?
Internal Locus of control means the belief that it was factors they controlled that led to their outcomes, it was their hard work and their extra effort that allowed them to do well on the puzzles right because how much work you put into something is something that you have complete control over.

Key points from the video are as follows:
* That there are 2 belief systems, External Locus of Control and Internal Locus of Control.
* External Locus of Control makes you put all the responsibility on external factors which you don't have control over, avoiding taking the burden of failure.
* Internal Locus of Control makes you put all the responsibility on internal factors which you have control over, making you feel joy over the success and sad due to also your failure as it's due to your work this result came.
* To adopt an Internal Locus of Control, you should take time to appreciate your hard work, believing the efforts you made resulted in success making you motivated to work harder.
