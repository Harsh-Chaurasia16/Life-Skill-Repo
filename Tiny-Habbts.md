### In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
For me, the most interesting idea is that good relationships are the strongest predictor of happiness and health, far more than wealth or fame. Focusing on meaningful connections leads to longer, healthier, and more fulfilling lives.

### How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P?
By using B = MAP we can make making new habits easier in the following ways:

* Start Small (Focus on Ability): Make the habit so simple that it’s hard to fail. For example, instead of “exercise for an hour,” start with “do one push-up.”

* Pair with Prompts: Use existing routines as prompts. For example, “After I brush my teeth, I’ll floss one tooth.”

* Boost Motivation Strategically: If motivation is high, tackle more challenging behaviours, but when motivation wanes, rely on habits that require less effort.

* Design for Simplicity: Remove barriers to action. For example, if you want to eat healthier, prep fruits in advance to make them easy to grab.

M i.e Motivation, A i.e. Ability and P i.e Prompt  which influences B i.e Behaviour.

### Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of a habit? (This is the most important concept in today's topic. Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit)

Celebrating after each successful completion of a habit reinforces positive feelings, making the behaviour more rewarding. It boosts motivation and helps solidify the habit, making it more likely to stick long-term.

The most interesting idea for me is the concept of compounding small improvements. it tells us that making tiny, consistent changes over time can lead to extraordinary results, similar to how compound interest works in finance.

### What is the book's perspective about Identity?

The book's perspective on identity is that our habits are a reflection of the person we believe ourselves to be. It suggests that to make lasting changes, we should focus on who we want to become, not just what we want to achieve. Instead of focusing solely on goals, it advocates for a shift to identity-based habits. This change in identity helps make new habits feel like a natural part of who we are, making them more sustainable and automatic over time.
