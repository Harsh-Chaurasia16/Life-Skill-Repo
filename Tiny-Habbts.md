The most interesting idea is that good relationships are the strongest predictor of happiness and health, far more than wealth or fame. Focusing on meaningful connections leads to longer, healthier, and more fulfilling lives.

## Tiny Habits by BJ Fogg - Core Message
### How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P?
By using B = MAP we can make making new habits easier in the following ways:

* Start Small (Focus on Ability): Make the habit so simple that it’s hard to fail. For example, instead of “exercise for an hour,” start with “do one push-up.”

* Pair with Prompts: Use existing routines as prompts. For example, “After I brush my teeth, I’ll floss one tooth.”

* Boost Motivation Strategically: If motivation is high, tackle more challenging behaviours, but when motivation wanes, rely on habits that require less effort.

* Design for Simplicity: Remove barriers to action. For example, if you want to eat healthier, prep fruits in advance to make them easy to grab.

M i.e Motivation, A i.e. Ability and P i.e Prompt  which influences B i.e Behaviour.

### Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of a habit? (This is the most important concept in today's topic. Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit)

Celebrating after each successful completion of a habit reinforces positive feelings, making the behaviour more rewarding. It boosts motivation and helps solidify the habit, making it more likely to stick long-term.

The most interesting idea for me is the concept of compounding small improvements. it tells us that making tiny, consistent changes over time can lead to extraordinary results, similar to how compound interest works in finance.

## Book Summary of Atomic Habits

### What is the book's perspective about Identity?

The book's perspective on identity is that our habits are a reflection of the person we believe ourselves to be. It suggests that to make lasting changes, we should focus on who we want to become, not just what we want to achieve. Instead of focusing solely on goals, it advocates for a shift to identity-based habits. This change in identity helps make new habits feel like a natural part of who we are, making them more sustainable and automatic over time. 

### Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do.
The book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do is as follows:
* The less effort or obstacles involved in a habit, the more likely you are to do it
* Make your environment so that the desired action becomes the easiest choice.
* Make it attractive, which makes doing it happy.
* Make it immediately rewarded, as we are more likely to do it repeatedly as it is satisfying.

### Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do.
The book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do is as follows:
* Increase the efforts or obstacles to make it harder to repeat.
* Design your environment that removes triggers or cues from your surroundings.
* Make the habit unattractive by setting undesirable consequences to the habit.
* Delay the gratification, which makes it less tempting to repeat the habit.

## Reflection
### Pick one habit that you would like to do more of. What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?
The one habit that I would like to do more of is to tidy my room. The steps that I'd take to make it easier to do are:

* I will make the cue obvious such as:
    * After changing my pyjamas, I will put away any clothes lying around.
    * After waking up tidy my bed
    * stick note in front of my study table to clear my table after done.
* I will make the habit attractive by always completing the task I would either have a "munch".
* I will make the habit easy by not doing the whole thing in one go but one thing at a time.
* I will track my progress by striking each day on the calendar on success to track my progress.

### Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of. What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?
The one habit that I'd like to eliminate or do less of is using Instagram on my phone and the steps to make the habit remove or less repetitive are as follows:

* By making the cue invisible, such as turning off the notification, or hiding the APP in a folder at the last of the screen.
* making the process unattractive by reminding myself of the time wasted while using it.
* I will make it hard to use the APP by logging out every time I close the APP.
* By committing that I will only use Instagram on my laptop.
* Tracking time of how much I spend on the APP, making it harder to ignore.
