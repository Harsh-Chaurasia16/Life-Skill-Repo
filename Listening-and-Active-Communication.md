# Listening and Active Communication

## Active Listening

### What are the steps/strategies to do Active Listening?
Steps/Strategies to do Active Listening are as follows
1. Avoid getting distracted by your thoughts, focus on the speaker and topic instead.
2. Try not to interrupt the other person.
3. Let the speaker finish and then respond.
4. Use door openers these are phrases that show you're interested and keep the other person talking.
5. Show that you're listening with body language.
6. If appropriate take notes during important conversations, and paraphrase what others have said to make sure you're both on the same page.

## Reflective Listening

### According to Fisher's model, what are the key points of Reflective Listening?
Fisher's model is a decision development model consisting of four stages, which are as follows:
1. Confirm Understanding: Clarify the message by rephrasing the speaker's dialogue in your way of understanding. 

2. Acknowledge Emotions: Address the emotions behind the words by saying things like, "I can sense that this has been quite challenging for you."

3. Match Non-Verbal Communication: Reflect the speakerâ€™s tone, gestures, and posture to demonstrate empathy and create a sense of connection.

4. Listen Without Interrupting: Allow the speaker to share their thoughts fully without cutting in or offering solutions too soon.

5. Verify and Clarify: Summarize the main points and ask for confirmation to ensure everyone is on the same page. For example, "Am I understanding correctly that your main concern is...?"

6. Stay Nonjudgmental: Avoid offering opinions or solutions unless asked. Focus on listening to understand rather than responding.
