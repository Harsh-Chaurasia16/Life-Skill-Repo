## Reflective Listening

### According to Fisher's model, what are the key points of Reflective Listening?
Fisher's model is a decision development model consisting of four stages, which are as follows:
1. Confirm Understanding: Clarify the message by rephrase the speaker's dialougue in your way of understanding. 

2. Acknowledge Emotions: Address the emotions behind the words by saying things like, "I can sense that this has been quite challenging for you."

3. Match Non-Verbal Communication: Reflect the speakerâ€™s tone, gestures, and posture to demonstrate empathy and create a sense of connection.

4. Listen Without Interrupting: Allow the speaker to share their thoughts fully without cutting in or offering solutions too soon.

5. Verify and Clarify: Summarize the main points and ask for confirmation to ensure everyone is on the same page. For example, "Am I understanding correctly that your main concern is...?"

6. Stay Non-Judgmental: Avoid offering opinions or solutions unless asked. Focus on listening to understand rather than to respond.
