# Learning Process

##  What is the Feynman Technique?

Feynman's technique states that if you cannot explain a concept in simple terms, you don't understand it fully.

## In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
The most interesting idea for me is the hiker analogy, as I can relate it more to real life. I think that we cannot choose between both, as sometimes we need a race car mindset to meet the deadline and sometimes a hiker mindset to learn the nitty-gritty of the topic. Hence, with this analogy, I got a new perspective on moving forward.


## What are active and diffused modes of thinking?
In active mode or Focus mode, when you're learning, you're often thinking tightly, as you're focusing on something i.e. concentrated on the work. It involves thoughts you're somewhat familiar with, historical patterns, or the multiplication table.  

In diffused mode, when you are learning let your mind relax and let the thoughts come subconsciously. For example when you solving a problem for a long time and are not able to solve then relax for a bit, and you find yourself getting new thoughts on solving it. It may or may not be the correct solution at least you are now not stuck in one place and that's what diffused mode means. 

## According to the video, what are the steps to take when approaching a new topic?
The steps to take when approaching a new topic are as follows:
* Deconstruct the skill
* Learn enough to self-correct
* Remove practice barriers
* Practice at least 20 hours

## What are some of the actions you can take going forward to improve your learning process?
The actions I would take going forward to improve my learning process are as follows: 
* First I'd deconstruct the skill or topic, basically before finding the 'hows' of the concept I'd search for 'what'.
* Then I'd pick 1-2 reliable sources for my learning process.
* Then I'd clear my environment of any distractions.
* now finally with a clear deadline in my mind I'll move forward in the learning giving sufficient time to its part to explore the details while also progressing forward inside the concept.
