# Good Practices for Software Development
## Which point(s) were new to you?
Points which were new to me are as follows:
  * While documenting requirements isn't new to me, sharing them with the team for feedback serves as a reference which I wasn't used to.
  * Joining meetings 5â€“10 minutes early to connect with teammates casually is new to me. As I like to work alone, it usually prevents me from interacting with my teammates at work.
## Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?
I think the area that needs improvement is "Stuck? Ask questions" when seeking help or addressing technical issues. While I aim to provide detailed and thoughtful responses, I either make them too vague or so roundabout that others misunderstand the question, though the ideas to make progress in it are as follows:
  * Study how issues are reported on GitHub or other open-source platforms, where clear problem descriptions are essential and use those methods in my explanation.
  * I will use screenshots, diagrams and screencast tools like Loom to show and explain clearly, as it would help others understand.
  * Also I would frame the question clearly by addressing the main issue, possibly with the cause, and describing the things which didn't work out to give the other person a better understanding of the problem.
